You shiver at the thought, the hairs on the back of your neck standing.\n\n“Oh, it’s Ricky!” Linh says, looking behind you.\n\nYou turn around and Ricky was indeed in line for some pasta. It was your first time seeing him during class time this semester, just as it was your first time seeing others at the dining hall around this hour: KC, Linh’s neighbor, and Sue’s roommate. Orange on Green seemed to bring everyone together.\n\nRicky had turned his head in your directions when Linh said his name. “Oh!” he says, finally spotting the two of you. He waves and you wave back. \n\n“What’re your next classes?” he asks as he sits besides Linh.\n\n“I have chem at 12,” Linh replies.\n\n“Ew,” Ricky says.",
