Orange on Green seemed to bring everyone together.\n\nRicky had turned his head in your directions when Linh said his name. “Oh!” he says, finally spotting the two of you. He waves and you wave back. \n\n“What’re your next classes?” he asks as he sits besides Linh.\n\n“I have chem at 12,” Linh replies.\n\n“Ew,” Ricky says.",

I’m gonna go to Bromley and make kimbap.”\n\nLinh suddenly dramatically gasps and points. “Tyler!” she yells.\n\nTyler, who was heading towards Green Street, turned. He waits as Linh darts towards him, with you following closely behind. They exchange a few words, and you ask if he wants kimbap.\n\n“Sure.”\n\n(You were gonna make some for him regardless of his answer.)\n\nThe three of you say your goodbyes, and you head to Bromley. You check your phone for updates. Helen and John responded, saying they were available to help. You then check the group chat: Norb asked if anyone wanted late night, and Helen replied with a maybe, depending on how long it would take to prepare kimbap.\n\nThey still haven’t sent a Massmail.\n\nYou didn’t realize how stupid it’d be to invite Helen and John with a murderer out and about until they arrived. They didn’t seem to either.\n\n“Yo, there was barely anyone on the bus,” Helen said. “I didn’t realize how dangerous it’d be until the bus was already moving.”\n\n“So are we still making kimbap then?” John asked.\n\n“I guess not,” you reply. “It’s not safe to go grocery shopping.”\n\nThe three of you pass the time spilling rumors surrounding the crime, until three phones nearly simultaneously sound.\n\n“They sent an email!” you announce, immediately recognizing the email preview.\n\nThe three of you dive for your phones.\n\n“Holy shit!” Helen exclaims. She pushes up her glasses as she begins reading the email. “‘We have been notified that students, faculty and staff have received an Illini Alert that links an article breaking news of a homicide on campus. We can assure you no such crime was committed, and the system overlooking the distribution of Illini Alerts is under investigation.’”\n\n“Bro,” John says.\n\n“That’s crazy,” Helen comments. “Does this mean they got hacked?”\n\n“But who would send out an alert about a murder?” you say.\n\n“Yeah, whoever did it took it too far,” Helen says.\n\n“But this means we can make kimbap!” you realize.\n\nYour phone buzzes in your hand. Linh texted you.\n\nLinh: i just realized making kimbap was a dumb idea bc you wouldn’t be able to give it to anyone if there really was a murderer on the loose\n\nLinh: but now you can :DDD\n\nYou: !!!\n\nYou: Now I make kimbap\n\nYou: Hopefully without getting murdered D:\n\nLinh: okie okie\n\nLinh: nah you gonna die :)))\n\nLinh: i’m in my dorm rn so you can stop by whenever!\n\nYou pause. Didn’t she say she was gonna be at the Union for her sorority?\n\nYou dismiss the thought. Whatever she was supposed to do must have been canceled.\n\nYour phone buzzes in your hand again. Sue texted the group chat.\n\nSue: r u guys still making kimbap?\n\nYou: Yes!\n\nSue: did u go get ingredients yet?\n\nYou: We’re about to go to Far East Grocery\n\nSue: oh okok\n\nSue: just b careful bc campus is hella shady now\n\nYou thumbs-up-reacted her message and got ready to head out.\n\nThe three of you take your time grocery shopping, and you finalize and pay for the ingredients. You’re following Helen and John out the store when you drop your pickled radish.\n\nJust when you pick it up, an elbow strikes the back of your head, your body dropping alongside the radish you accidentally release again. There’s yelling, but voices blur together and you can’t tell who’s yelling or where it’s coming from.\n\nSomething rocky gives another blow. It was so powerful it probably broke in half as soon as it landed on your head, but you can’t even feel the throbbing pain",

I’m gonna go to my brother’s apartment and make kimbap.”\n\nLinh suddenly dramatically gasps and points. “Tyler!” she yells.\n\nTyler, who was heading towards Green Street, turned. He waits as Linh darts towards him, with you following closely behind. They exchange a few words, and you ask if he wants kimbap.\n\n“Sure.”\n\n(You were gonna make some for him regardless of his answer.)\n\nThe three of you say your goodbyes, and you head back to your brother’s apartment. You check your phone for updates. Norb asked if anyone wanted late night, and people were saying yes.\n\nThey still haven’t sent a Massmail.\n\nAs you reached your brother’s apartment, you realized grocery shopping with a murderer out and about wasn’t a good idea. You instead spend the next few hours crocheting—another hobby you recently picked up, and one that didn’t involve going outside.\n\nAn Outlook notification sound goes off, and you glance at your phone. Upon spotting the word “MASSMAIL”, you practically shove the bunny you were crocheting away from you as you scramble to open the email you’ve been awaiting. You scan the text until you got to its core: “We have been notified that students, faculty and staff have received an Illini Alert that links an article breaking news of a homicide on campus. We can assure you no such crime was committed, and the system overlooking the distribution of Illini Alerts is under investigation.”\n\nYou wonder who would pull such a prank, but you decide not to worry about it. You realize you can make kimbap—with Helen and John too. You send them a text and set out to Far East Grocery.\n\nYour phone buzzes in your hand. Linh texted you.\n\nLinh: i just realized making kimbap was a dumb idea bc you wouldn’t be able to give it to anyone if there really was a murderer on the loose\n\nLinh: but now you can :DDD\n\nYou: !!!\n\nYou: Now I make kimbap\n\nYou: Hopefully without getting murdered D:\n\nLinh: okie okie\n\nLinh: nah you gonna die :)))\n\nLinh: i’m in my dorm rn so you can stop by whenever!\n\nYou pause. Didn’t she say she was gonna be at the Union for her sorority?\n\nYou dismiss the thought. Whatever she was supposed to do must have been canceled.\n\nYour phone buzzes in your hand again. Helen and John responded, and you tell them to meet at Bromley when they would be free. Within a few hours, you were able to go shopping and meet up with Helen and John to make a large quantity of kimbap. The three of you are now on your ways to FAR/PAR.\n\nIt is 10:00 PM. Helen asks you and John when everyone should meet up at Ricky’s and Tyler’s room, taking into account the people who were eating late night.",

Linh had just finished using the bathroom.\n\n“We should go back,” KC says in a low voice.\n\n“Yeah,” you agree.\n\nYou didn’t realize what a horrible decision it was until everyone came back. If someone in the group really was trying to kill you, that means if everyone is present, there’s a hundred percent chance the murderer is there.\n\nWhile everyone jokes and banters, you sit in silence, observing everyone. The only one who is off is KC, who throws nervous glances at you, every now and then, but that’s because she knows.\n\n“Miguel, are you okay?” Ricky asks.\n\n“Someone here is trying to kill me,” you blurt.\n\nHalf the room goes silent, the other half goes, “What?”",

I NEED HIM DEAD.”\n\nSeven against one, Ricky is unable to land an attack on you. You stare at him, shocked and speechless, while everyone else was fiercely yelling.\n\nThe door to the dorm bursts open, and in the doorway was a young man you don’t recognize. Was he the RA?\n\n“What’s going—holy shit.”\n\nRicky grows more rabid, and even seven people struggle with keeping him in place. The stranger notices the syringe, walks in the room, and seizes it. He did it so effortlessly he almost stunned the room into silence.\n\n“What is this? A tranquilizer?”\n\nSuddenly, Ricky leaps onto the stranger, knocking him over to the floor. It quickly dawns on the stranger that Ricky’s intent was murderous. Panicking, the stranger injects the needle into Ricky’s neck, immediately slowing his movements until he completely stops.\n\nYou thought you have never been more afraid when he was ready to stab you with that exact needle, but witnessing Ricky’s death was something that haunted your mind and permanently scarred your soul.",
